# Sockets
There are four types of socket available. The first two are commonly used and the last two are rarely used.
1. Stream socket : Delivery in a network environment is guranteed. If delivery is impossible, sender receives an error. Used in TCP protocol. Order of data is preserved.
2. Datagram socket : Delivery in a networked environment is not guaranteed. They're connectionless because you don't need to have an open connection as in Stream Sockets âˆ’ you build a packet with the destination information and send it out. They use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
3. Raw socket
4. Sequence Packet Socket
