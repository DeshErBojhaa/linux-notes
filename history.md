## A Brif History of UNIX
- First implemented in 1969 by **Ken Thompson**. (Same year Linus Travalds born)
- The name *UNIX* is a pun on *MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)*
- Initially it was written in assmbly. But later on was re-written in `C`

At one point UNIX had 2 main distribution, one is called `BSD` built by Ken along with his students, another one was `System V(system five)` built by AT&T.

## A Brif History of Linux
### The GNU Project
In 1984 **Richard Staleman** set to work on creating a free UNIX implementation.
At that time existing UNIX like OS (BSD and System V) was not freely available.
In response to that, he started a new project to create a free UNIX like system. The project was named `GNU (GNU's not UNIX)`. Some important GNU project outcomes are `GCC`, `emacs` editor and `bash`. By the early 1990 GNU had produced a system that is virtually complete, except a working kernel.

### The Linux Kernel
