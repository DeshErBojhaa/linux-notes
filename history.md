## A Brif History of UNIX
- First implemented in 1969 by **Ken Thompson**. (Same year Linus Travalds born)
- The name *UNIX* is a pun on *MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)*
- Initially it was written in assmbly. But later on was re-written in `C`

At one point UNIX had 2 main distribution, one is called `BSD` built by Ken along with his students, another one was `System V(system five)` built by AT&T.

## A Brif History of Linux
### The GNU Project
In 1984 **Richard Staleman** set to work on creating a free UNIX implementation.
At that time existing UNIX like OS (BSD and System V) was not freely available.
In response to that, he started a new project to create a free UNIX like system. The project was named `GNU (GNU's not UNIX)`. Some important GNU project outcomes are `GCC`, `emacs` editor and `bash`. By the early 1990 GNU had produced a system that is virtually complete, except a working kernel.

### The Linux Kernel
In 1991 **Linus Torvalds** a Finnish student was inspired to write an operatiog system for his intel 80386. He was using `Minux` a small UNIX like operation system for his academic purpose. But that OS was not able to run all the softwares.

## Standarization
By late 1980's there were a wide variety of available UNIX implementations. Everybody was implementing things in their way. So it was essential to set a standard.

### POSIX
POSIX stands for Portable Operation System Interface. It has a trailing `X` because most UNIX varients end in X.
POSIX.1 became IEEE standard in 1988. It defines a set of APIs. POSIX.1 is based on UNIX system calls and C library function API.
